# githubToPDF

githubToPDF is a script that can be used to get the basic information from a users github page turned into a PDF for quick viewing.

## How to Use

Run the index.js file in node and answer the prompted questions. This will create a PDF file in the directory for you to view that has the basic info from a github user profile that you entered.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge when tackling this project was trying to figure out the pdf conversion and getting the promises to await in time for the resulting pdf not to have old information from the previous file.
